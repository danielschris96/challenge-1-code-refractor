# Horiseon Accessibility Refactoring

## Description 

The Horiseon accessibility refactoring project aimed to refactor the HTML and CSS code behind the Horiseon webpage to improve accessibility.
Accessibility is a major consideration in modern web design. Making webpages more accessible to internet users with disabilities is necessary in creating a more inclusive internet. Increased accessibility also improves search engine optimization, putting more eyes on a website than a less accessible counterpart.Good accessibility also protects companies from litigation. Overall, improving the accessibility of webpages holds many perks for those who own them and for those who visit them.

The Horiseon webpage was refactored by simplifying the HTML and CSS code. HTML code was restructured and made more accessible with alt tags. CSS code was consolidated while maintaining the same website appearance. HTML was adjusted to improve functionality of the website.
